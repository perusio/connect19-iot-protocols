# constrained devices

* IETF Definition: **[`tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7228`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7228)**
* limited processing power
* unreliable networking
* low power _(so they can run on batteries)_

# internet: a definition

<br/>
<br/>

> "A computer network consisting of a worldwide network of computer networks that use the TCP/IP network protocols to facilitate data transmission and exchange."

# **edge** has devices - **cloud** has servers

# edge 

devices $\neq$ gateways

<br/>

* devices talk to other **devices northbound and southbound** 
* gateways talk to the **cloud northbound and devices southbound**
* device to device **(d2d)**
* device to cloud **(d2c)**
