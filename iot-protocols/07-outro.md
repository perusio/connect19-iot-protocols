# conclusions

* there are many type of networks
* the protocol to use **depends** on what part of **which** network
  you are interested in

# opinionated cheatsheet

 * MQTT $\implies$ d2c or c2c
 * CoAP $\implies$ d2d
 * HTTP/1.1 $\implies$ c2c
 * HTTP/2 $\implies$ c2c &mdash; possibly d2c
 * DDS $\implies$ c2c & d2c &mdash; claims of d2d seem exagerated
 * WebSockets $\implies$ c2c

bottom line: **there is no silver bullet**
